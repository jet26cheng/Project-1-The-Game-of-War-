# Project-1-The-Game-of-War-

The Project I am purposing is the Card game war 

In the card game war it is a simple game that will have 2 players go against each other with each respected player having half of the deck of tradtional playing cards 1-10, jacks, queens, kings, and Aces in 4 different suits (clovers,hearts, spades, diamonds 

How this game works is that 





User Stories-  

the game will have 2 players 

there will be 2 name submit bars and on the top and bottom of the screen 

when the player clicks on the play button there will be 2 decks that will appear on the screen representing player 1 and player 2 decks 

the players will press anywhere on the screen to make the cards flip and the card with the higher value would win 

the winner will take the cards and put them into the winning player's deck 

the winner will be decided only when one player does not have any more cards in there deck.
