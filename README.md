# Project-1-The-Game-of-War-

The Project I am purposing is the Card game war 

In the card game war it is a simple game that will have 2 players go against each other with each respected player having half of the deck of tradtional playing cards 1-10, jacks, queens, kings, and Aces in 4 different suits (clovers,hearts, spades, diamonds 





### User Stories-  

-The game will have 2 players 

-There will be 2 name submit bars and on the top and bottom of the screen 

-There will be 2 decks that will appear on the screen representing player 1 and player 2 decks 

 

-The players will press anywhere on the screen to make the cards flip and the card with the higher value would win which will be displayed in the middle of the screen which player won the immediate face off of cards.

-The cards will be added into the winning player's deck and will automaticlly be shuffled so it would be impossible to count and predict the card order of each respected player's deck 

-The winner of the game will be decided only when one player does not have any more cards in there deck.

### MVP Goals!!! 

**As a player, I want my game to be able to recognize which player won in each respected face off** 

**As a player, I want to be able to have the game display the win condition when one player taking all the cards and one player does have any cards in their deck.** 

**As a player I want the game to be able to displayer each card that is being flipped over so the player can see the value of each respected card.** 

**As a player I want the game to be able to display a replay button once the win condition is met. So the game can restart and be played again!**
